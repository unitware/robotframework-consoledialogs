    `ConsoleDialogs` is a replacement for the `Dialogs` Robot Framework's
    standard library that provides means for pausing the test execution and
    getting input from users. The dialogs are slightly different depending on
    are tests run on Python or Jython but they provide the same functionality.

    Long lines in the provided messages are wrapped automatically since

    The library has following two limitations:
    - It is not compatible with IronPython.
    - It cannot be used with timeouts on Python.
